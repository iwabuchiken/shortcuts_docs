1) Introduction
 Hello madam, sir. I am a Japanese citizen living in Kawasaki City.
 I was reading the above article, which was about the so-called `clashes` between palestinian protestors and the Israeli occupation forces.
 
2) Opinion
 My opinion is : These palestinians did not `clash` with the Israeli forces. They `defended` from the violence of the occupation forces. Just like, in my opinion, the late general Soleimani did not `clash` with the US assassination forces, he was `defending` the people.

2) Request
 I have been noticing that in the presstv articles, the author almost always use the word `clash` instead of `attack`, `crack` or other sort of words.
 So, my request is, please choose the word when reporting on this kind of incidents. Please use more descriptive or explanatory expressions so that the reader can get a hint about the power balance between the protesters and the charging forces.

3) Lastly
 NonEtheless, I read presstv articles everyday. Your coverage of Palestinian people, I always read them. Headlines and so on. My regards.
