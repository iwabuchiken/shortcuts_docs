An Israeli Border Police officer shot and killed a Palestinian man at point-blank range in the town of Huwwara, near the West Bank city of Nablus, on Friday.

The harrowing incident, captured on video recorded from multiple angles, comes days after Kobi Shabtai, Israel’s police chief, praised officers for killing a Palestinian who they allege carried out a car ramming attack at a checkpoint.

“A dead terrorist is what I want to see,” Shabtai said after Rani Mamoun Fayez Abu Ali, 45, was killed on Tuesday.

Shabtai’s comments are not the first from a senior officer encouraging field executions of Palestinians.

Human rights groups have long accused Israel’s civilian leadership, in the words of B’Tselem, of responsibility for “the transformation of police officers, and even of armed civilians, into judges and executioners” who slay Palestinians suspected of armed attacks in the streets.

The Palestinian executed in Huwwara on Friday was identified as Ammar Hamdi Nayef Miflih. Media outlets gave his age as 22 or 23.




Israel claimed that the shooting was in response to a stabbing attack, but video appears to show that Miflih was not holding anything in his hands when he was shot and killed.
And as the Tel Aviv-based newspaper Haaretz acknowledged, an eyewitness who was at the scene contradicted “the police’s version of events, saying that an armed settler who passed by the checkpoint provoked several people who were standing near a restaurant eating lunch, when a fight broke out between him and Ammar Miflih.”

Video of the moments before the shooting shows two men attempting to pull Miflih from the grasp of an Israeli Border Police officer before the officer succeeds in breaking away from the men with his arm around Miflih’s neck.
The video shows Miflih breaking away from the officer’s grip before he starts hitting the officer and grabbing at his rifle. In quick succession, the rifle drops to the ground – apparently from Miflih’s hands – and Miflih backs away from the soldier, who opens fire at Miflih with a handgun and then runs over to pick up his rifle.

At no time does Miflih appear to attempt to use the rifle or do anything other than defend himself from the armed Israeli officer. Notably, according to the account of a Palestinian eyewitness, Miflih had already been shot and injured by an Israeli settler prior to this struggle with the Border Police officer who eventually killed him.
