1) Introduction
 Hello sir, madam. I am a Japanese citizen living in Kawasaki City.
 I was reading the other day, another article(https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2021/12/24/673295/Iran-fires-ballistic-missiles-stark-warning-Israel-drills-end), in which the above article was being mentioned. I came to know that your country has a military drone named `kamikaze`.
 
2) Request
 My request to your country is this: Please, in the future, when upgrading your military drone program, consider about changing the name of this `kamikaze` drone.

2) Why?
 I assume the word `kamikaze` connotes different meanings for each national and individual.
 For Japanese people? I do not know.
 For me, `kamikaze` connotes what `kamikaze` program was, in my mind, in the late Japanese Imperial military.
 Any beautiful poems cannot hide the outrage that the upper echelon of the military compensates their abject failure of waging the war, on the lives of ranks and files. ABSOLUTELY not.
 `Kamikaze` is, for me, like the treacherous abandonment by the Japanese military in the late Manchuria, of the Japanese settlers in the areas. Such a neglection against the lives of common people. 

4) Understanding
 I think I understand the reason your military used that word for the name. If the history, as I understand, was a bit different, I would be feeling honored that your military did take the word `kamikaze` for one of your, so I surmise, crucial wearponries.

5) Last words
 Regardless of the message above, I respect the Iranian Revolution, Iranian people. I send my moment of silence for the late General Soleimani. I read presstv everyday. Thank you.
