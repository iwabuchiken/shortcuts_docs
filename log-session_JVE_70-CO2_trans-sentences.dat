Israeli military forces have shot and killed a young Palestinian man over an alleged stabbing attempt in northern part of the occupied West Bank, amid tensions in the occupied territories over illegal Israeli settlement activities and its planned eviction of Palestinian families from their ancestral homes.

The Israeli army alleged in statement that the man had arrived at a junction near the Jewish settlement of Ariel in a car, got out and "armed with a knife, ran toward the bus station” where settlers and Israeli forces were standing."

Israeli troops opened fire at the Palestinian man, killing him, the statement added.

Photographs from the scene showed the Palestinian on the ground next to a bus stop full of Israel soldiers.

He was taken to Petah Tikva’s Beilinson Medical Center in critical condition and was pronounced dead upon arrival.

The Israeli military said it was setting up roadblocks in the area as it worked to find the car that transported the assailant to the scene in order to arrest those inside.

Back on December 21, Israeli forces shot dead a young Palestinian man near the occupied West Bank city of Jenin after his car was fired at over what they claimed to be a car-ramming attack on their checkpoint.

Palestine’s official WAFA news agency said the Palestinian, identified as Abd al-Aziz Hekmat Mousa, was killed when the Israeli troops at a checkpoint in the town of Ya'bad, southwest of the city of Jenin, opened fire at the vehicle he was traveling in.

The Tel Aviv regime has been criticized for its extensive use of lethal force against and extrajudicial killing of Palestinians who do not pose an immediate threat to the occupation forces or to the Israeli settlers.
