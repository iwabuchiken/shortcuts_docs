Iranians are commemorating Gaza Day across the country to show solidarity with Palestinians residing in the besieged coastal enclave, urging them to keep up their struggles against the Aviv regime’s incessant acts of aggression and criminal acts.

The ceremonies are mostly being held online, amid the concerns over the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The day was designated after the full-case offensive on the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli regime recommenced on December 27, 2008 and pounded the densely populated Palestinian territory from the air, sea and land for 22 days.

More than 2,000 Palestinians were killed in Israel's three-week-long operation, named by Israel as "Operation Cast Lead," including dozens of children and women. A total of 13 Israelis were also killed in attacks by Palestinian resistance factions.

Nearly 200 Palestinians, mostly security personnel, were killed on the first day of the Israeli offensive on the seaside enclave.

Iranians also mark the Gaza Day to underscore the fact that resistance, broadly speaking, is not only the ability to fight back against an oppressor that is militarily more powerful, but also the ability to creatively resist the colonization of one’s land.


Even though Israel launched massive attacks against Gaza in 2009, 2012, 2014 and in May 2020, none of its “objectives” of the genocidal onslaughts – putting an end to the rocket fire from Gaza and destroying the tunnels used by resistance fighters and obfuscating any form of unity between occupied al-Quds and Gaza – has been achieved.

Retaliatory rockets are still being launched and the Hamas resistance movement has proved to be strong enough to respond to any act of aggression by apartheid Israel against al-Quds and the holy al-Aqsa Mosque compound.

Gaza, home to some two million Palestinians, has been under Israeli siege since June 2007.  The tight blockade has caused a decline in the standards of living as well as unprecedented levels of unemployment and unrelenting poverty.

Apparently caught off guard by the unprecedented barrage of rockets from Gaza, Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire on May 21, which Palestinian resistance movements accepted with Egyptian mediation.

In the latest Israeli bombardment campaign against the Gaza Strip, at least 260 Palestinians, including over 60 children, were killed in a time span of 11 days that began on May 10 last year.

That came following Palestinian retaliation for violent Israeli raids on worshipers at al-Aqsa Mosque and the regime’s plans to force a number of Palestinian families out of their homes at the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East al-Quds.


In response, Palestinian resistance movements, chief among them Hamas, launched Operation al-Quds Sword and fired more than 4,000 rockets and missiles into the occupied territories, killing 12 Israelis.
