China has warned the United States against trying to build a Pacific version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and urged Washington to stop its interference in Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi revealed on Monday that the "real goal" of the United States in the Indo-Pacific was to establish a NATO like military alliance there, Bloomberg reported.

“The perverse actions run counter to the common aspiration of the region for peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcomes,” Wang said. “They are doomed to fail.”

China has maintained that the United States has been attempting to suppress its growth via bloc coalitions and maddingly in Chinese affairs.

Wang also made some of China's most direct comments against the unending US interference in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported.

“This would not only push Taiwan into a precarious situation, but will also bring unbearable consequences for the US side,” Wang said, declaring that “Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland.”

China has called on the United States to strictly abide by the "One China" principle when handling issues related to Taipei, stressing that Beijing would not compromise on its core interests.

China has sovereignty over Chinese Taipei, and under the "One China" policy, almost all world countries recognize that sovereignty. The US, too, recognizes Chinese sovereignty over the island but has long courted Taipei in an attempt to unnerve Beijing.

The United States, which backs Taipei's secessionist president, also continues to sell weapons to the island in defiance of Beijing and in violation of its own official policy.

Relations between the US and China have grown tense in recent years, with the world's two largest economies clashing over a range of issues, including trade, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, military activities in the South China Sea, and the origins of the new coronavirus.

Russia's ongoing military action in Ukraine has drawn many comparisons to China and Taiwan, an assertion Wang called a "double standard."

“Some, while being vocal about the principle of sovereignty on the Ukrainian issue, have kept undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan question -- this is a blatant double standard,” Wang said.

In addition, Wang described China's relationship with Russia as “one of the most crucial bilateral relationships in the world."

Russian President Vladimir Putin last month ordered a “special military operation” in Ukraine’s Donbas region to “defend people” subjected to "genocide" there against government forces, stressing that Moscow has “no plans to occupy Ukrainian territory.”

US President Joe Biden called the Russian action an "unprovoked and unjustified attack," and the American media described it as the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two assault by Russia.
