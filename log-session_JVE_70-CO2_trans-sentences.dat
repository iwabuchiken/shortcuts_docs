Pro-Palestinian fighter and global hero Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has once again been denied his freedom by French courts. That has many saying Europe’s oldest political prisoner has effectively been handed a death sentence, but Abdallah’s supporters say they’ll never stop demanding his liberation.

In 1982 Israel was invading Lebanon, yet again. Abdallah’s resistance group accepted responsibility for the death of Israeli and American agents in Paris, saying they were legitimate acts of resistance against a foreign occupation.

Abdallah’s trial was noted for its lack of proof, and his own lawyer later confessed to secretly working for the government.

Ultimately, it seems that France has inaccurately classified Abdallah not as a soldier but as a common criminal.

There have been favorable court decisions for Abdallah over the decades, but governmental interference have not allowed them to be implemented or respected. If France refuses to let their courts release Abdallah, then it seems they are intent on forcing him to die in jail, and in a country which prides itself on having abolished the death penalty a few decades ago.

Abdallah refuses to repent or to recant his support for Palestine, and many believe that’s a primary reason why he hasn’t been released.

The fight for the liberation of Georges Abdallah has gone from total obscurity to becoming an international cause, with anti-French protests recently held in North Africa, Lebanon and even Latin America. Demonstrators say that they, and Abdallah’s supporters worldwide, will never stop fighting for his liberation from French injustice.
