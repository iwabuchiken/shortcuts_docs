Hamas slams Abu Akleh’s ‘premeditated murder’

The Palestinian resistance group Hamas condemned in the strongest terms what it called the “premeditated murder” of the Palestinian journalist.

It said the world and all international institutions must condemn the heinous crime against the press and free speech and hold the Israeli regime accountable.

This crime will not succeed in preventing the role of the media and free journalists in conveying the truth, the reality of the Israeli occupation, its brutality, terrorism, and crimes against the Palestinian people, land, and holy sites, the Gaza-based resistance group added.

Qatar: Israeli terrorism has to end

Qatar’s deputy foreign minister also condemned the killing by the “Israeli occupation” and called for an end to the “state sponsored Israeli terrorism.”

“Israeli occupation killed Aljazeera journalist Sherine Abu Aqleh by shooting her in the face while wearing the Press vest and a helmet,” Lolwah Alkhater wrote in a tweet.

“She was covering their attack in Jenin refugee camp. This state sponsored Israeli terrorism must STOP, unconditional support to Israel must END,” she added.
