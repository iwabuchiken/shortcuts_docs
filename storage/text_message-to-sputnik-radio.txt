Dear sputnik radio staff members

I am a listener of your radio shows. I listen to "Loud & Clear" and "By Any Means", especially. Both inform me with such topics that I always amazed how I was ignorant about the world.

Two appeals here to the show "Loud & Clear"
1) First appeal
 In the show, Mr. Becker converses with his co-host, staff members and guests. What I notice is that Mr. Becker, maybe because such is the way American people converse, or he is aching about the time limit of the show, when the other person finishes her/his comments, he moves to the next topic or next person, without a remark or "hmm" or any response to the thus-far-speaking person. When I hear (or, unhear) those responses, my chest sinks.

 So, my appeal is, can you, staff members, consider about the afore-mentioned practices? Or, maybe I am personally over-sensing the normality of people. The staff members, guest people, and audiences. If they are fine with that, it is just that. Pease drop this email.

2) Second appeal
 This one is also maybe a minute poking.
 Again in "Loud & Clear", at the end of the show, Mr. Kiriaku narrates a line, promoting the show, saying, "if you enjoyed the show...."
 I am a no-doubt fan of Mr. Kiriaku. Just this line, "if you enjoyed". Nuclear issues, criminal injustice, women's issues. Great show. But, for me personally, I never "enjoy" the show.
 I am devastated after the show. I get so gloomy after the show. So disgusted, aghasted, infuriated and all. Also, I get enlighted, amazed, encouraged, relieved that there are pepople like Mr. Covalek in Kalamazoo.
 So, I am not offering any alternative, but... I just want communicate to you what I am feeling. Thinking about it, yes, other than the term "enjoyed?", not many comes to my head now. "If you are enlightened, let us know..." Well, kinda overposing, yes. Anyhow.
 
 Thank you for listening to my rather directionless monologue. Thank you all for the shows.
