One of the videos initially censored by Instagram is that of Muna al-Kurd, a Palestinian woman who had lost her home in Sheikh Jarrah to a Jewish settler by the name of Yakub.


“Yakub, you know this is not your house,” Muna is seen outside her home, speaking to Yakub.


Yakub answers, “Yes, but if I go, you don’t go back.

So what’s the problem? Why are you yelling at me? I didn’t do this.

I didn’t do this.

It’s easy to yell at me, but I didn’t do this.




Muna: “You are stealing my house.”


Yakub: “And if I don’t steal it, someone else is going to steal it.”


Muna: “No.

No one is allowed to steal it.” 


The untold story of Sheikh Jarrah, of Jerusalem – in fact, of all of Palestine – is that of Muna and Yakub, the former representing Palestine, the latter, Israel.

For justice to ever be attained, Muna must be allowed to reclaim her stolen home and Yakub must be held accountable for his crime.
