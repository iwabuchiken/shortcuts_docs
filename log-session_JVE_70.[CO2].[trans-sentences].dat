The British Labour Party once again faces accusation of Islamophobia and racism as a Muslim member was rejected for a Councillor post as he held so-called “extremist views.” These views included social media posts where he expressed solidarity with Palestine and condemned Israeli crimes in Gaza. The Labour Party leadership has taken a strong pro-Israel stance ever since the current leader, Sir Keir Starmer, took over in April 2020.

Accusations of racism and Islamophobia again surround the UK Labour Party as a Muslim member from London was allegedly rejected in his bid to become a Party councilor because he held “extremist views.”

Mizanur Rahman’s from Harrow East in East London, claims that his application was rejected because of pro-Palestine social media posts.

Since joining the party in 2016, Rahman has voiced his criticism of Israel over the regime’s killing of Palestinians. This was noticed by Harrow East’s EC Chair Kandy Dolor, who allegedly warned the party that Rahman’s views were “extremist.”

Press TV contacted the office of Harrow East for a reaction. Dolor responded saying she won't comment on the case but added: We totally and strongly reject allegations of Islamophobia or discrimination of any kind.

Mr Rahman has launched an official complaint to the party but this isn't the only time Labour has been branded racist or Islamophobic by its membership. So, with so many accusations, how long can the party keep its title as the home for British minorities?
