In general, microalgae can utilize NH4+, NO3−, NO2−, NO, and N2 nitrogen in their metabolism.

The combustion gas contained nitrogen sources as NO (90–95%) and NO2 (5–10%).

When these compounds are dissolved in water, nitric acid (HNO3) or nitrous acid (HNO2) can be formed and used in microalgal metabolism.

However, because the pH in most cultures is higher than 4, the predominant acid forms are NO3− and NO2− (Hende et al., 2012).

In C.

fusca LEB 111 cultures there was no inhibition of cell growth by the presence of NO in the culture medium at any of the gas concentrations studied.



Studies by Tastan et al.

(2012) found that microalga Chlorella sp.

showed higher resistance to NO than to SO2. However, the results obtained in this study for the same microalgal genus evaluated by these authors, demonstrated that cell growth in cultures was identical in experiments in which SO2 and NO were added separately (experiments 3 and 4, Fig.

2), with the same values for biomass productivity and maximum specific growth rate (p > 0.10) (Table 2).



The performance of CO2 biofixation and biomass production are directly influenced by microalgal morphological characteristics (Zhao and Su, 2014).

Among microalgal genera with CO2 mitigation potential in culture medium containing flue gas residues, Chlorella usually performs better in terms of growth and adaptation to culture conditions (Chiu et al., 2008, Yeh and Chang, 2012).

The highest rates and efficiencies of CO2 biofixation (Table 3) were obtained in experiments with 10% CO2, 60 ppm SO2 and 100 ppm NO, with and without the presence of ash (40 ppm) as well as in an experiment with 10% CO2, 200 ppm SO2 and NO and 40 ppm ash (p < 0.10).

CO2 biofixation by C.fusca LEB 111 in a medium containing industrial wastes such as SO2, NO and ash, can be explained by their morphology.

This microalgal species is eucaryotic with their chlorophyll molecules organized into chloroplasts, unlike in prokaryotic microalgae, which contain chlorophyll in the cell membrane and in vesicular structures (chromophores).

The level of Chlorella chloroplast membrane organization confers structural protection that may generate higher resistance to highly oxidative molecular species from the wastes present in flue gas (Tastan et al., 2012).
