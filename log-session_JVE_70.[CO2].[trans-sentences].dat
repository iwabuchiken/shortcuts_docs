Upon reflecting back to Kahane’s short time in the Knesset, Rabbi Sattath said he faced opposition from every politician and was immediately ostracized.“When he got into the Knesset, he got the bare minimum [of votes] to get one seat.But what happened in the eighties was he was boycotted by every other Knesset member.Nobody would sit in the plenum when he was speaking,” Rabbi Sattath said.“Everybody from the left and the right understood that these ideas were dangerous and extreme and had to be restrained.” Today, the political climate in Israeli politics is different.]]“What we’re seeing now is that the restraint is completely over,” Rabbi Sattath continued.“And we’re hoping that by shedding light on the past weeks’ violence, we can return to the understanding that there needs to be a red line, that these violent militias and racist, Jewish supremacists have to be stopped.” Feature photo | An Israeli man stands in front of a burning car during mob violence against Israeli Arabs in the city of Lod, May 11, 2021.
