The purpose of this research note is to present a practical study of theabove question in three dimensions. We compare meshes generated with twofreely available programs,Mmg3d[1] andTetGen[7], by using isotropic mesh sizing functions. This study provides a fair justification of the state-of-the-artmetric-based methods for adaptive mesh generation.
