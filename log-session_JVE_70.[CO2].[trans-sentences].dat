The long march and the party’s metamorphosis

After the defeat and massacre in Shanghai and Guangzhou, the CCP was decimated. The bloodbath that Chiang Kaishek’s party dealt it caused an ebb that led to profound changes within the party. The leadership remained in the hands of Mao Tse Tung, who developed the organization’s activity linked to the great masses of poor peasants, enthusiastic about the agrarian revolution that the party carried out in the village of Juchi, where a soviet republic was declared in 1931, making the national government react with an offensive, which forced the “long march” towards Shenshi province. In addition to this element, the metamorphosis of the party also began as a result of its composition and the orientation taken by Mao to transform itself into a guerrilla army. The 1930s will also be marked by Japan’s offensive to turn China into its colony, re-motivating the sentiment of national-liberation. At the end of the Second World War, with Japan on the defeated side, Mao’s party did not advance against the national government still held by the Kuomintang. The CCP once again joined the Stalinist policy of class conciliation. In 1949, however, supported by the expansive wave of victory over Nazism, the CCP unleashed a civil war against the Kuomitang after it broke the agreement to hold a Constituent Assembly and the unify the armed forces (People’s Army of Liberation and National Revolutionary Army). The victory won by the CCP impacted a large part of the world vanguard, making guerrilla warfare the preferred method of seizing power, making all kinds of abstractions and generalizations, without considering the conditions that allowed it to triumph in China. As Argentine revolutionary Nahuel Moreno highlighted, the revisionism of that time could be characterized as pre-Trotskyist, where “the permanent revolution is being rediscovered by different segments. So far they have reached, at best, a revisionist and evolutionist variant of this theory: the revolution will inexorably advance from the countryside to the city, from the colonial peoples to the industrialized ones, from the guerrillas to the seizure of power, refusing to consider it in all its dialectic and breadth.”5
