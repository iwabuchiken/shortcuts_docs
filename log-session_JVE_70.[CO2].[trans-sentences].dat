Panda3D contains a data structure called the Scene Graph. The Scene Graph is a tree containing all objects that need to be rendered. At the root of the tree is an object named render. Nothing is rendered until it is first inserted into the Scene Graph.

To install the grassy scenery model into the Scene Graph, we use the method reparentTo(). This sets the parent of the model, thereby giving it a place in the Scene Graph. Doing so makes the model visible in the scene.

Finally, we adjust the position and scale of the model. In this particular case, the environment model is a little too large and somewhat offset for our purposes. The setScale() and setPos() procedures rescale and center the model.

Panda3D uses the “geographical” coordinate system where position (-8, 42, 0) means map coordinates (8, 42) and height 0. If you are used to OpenGL/Direct3D coordinates, then hold up your right hand in the classical position with thumb as X, fingers as Y, and palm as Z facing toward you; then tilt backward until your hand is level with the fingers pointing away and palm facing up. Moving “forward” in Panda3D is a positive change in Y coordinate.
