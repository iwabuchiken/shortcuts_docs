This is what capitalism looks like nearly 40 years later in “liberated” Grenada, elections and all. And it was totally avoidable. Rather than only looking at the PRG as an experiment which went tragically wrong, in his study Beyond Coloniality: Citizenship and Freedom in the Caribbean Intellectual Tradition political theorist Aaron Kamugisha more appropriately called the Grenada Revolution an “unrealized political possibility.” It is a political possibility that deserves to be put forward as an alternative model in today’s context where the political imagination of the Caribbean is handcuffed to neoliberalism.

The PRG was  working to build a revolution in an underdeveloped, small island nation. The terrifying thing for the US and the neo-colonial puppets in the region such as Edward Seaga , Eugenia Charles , and John Compton was that it was working. That the PRG would carry out reforms aimed at improving the lives of the masses made sense - the entire platform of the PRG was to overturn the economic and political inheritances from colonial time and build an unlikely Grenadian model.
