According to Syria's official news agency SANA, Saleh was killed on Saturday while returning home in the Syrian village of Ain al-Tinah.

The news agency did not provide further information.

According to Israeli media, locals reported a heavy presence of helicopters and UAVs in the nearby Israeli-occupied town of Majdal Shams on Saturday.

Israel’s military did not comment on the report.

Born in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, Saleh was arrested by Israeli forces in 1983, and following his release, he was arrested again in 1985 and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

He left for Syria in 1998, a year after he was released from his 12-year imprisonment, and then worked to establish a committee to support prisoners and detainees.

He served as a member of Syria’s Parliament until 2005, and was later appointed as head of the Golan Heights’ portfolio by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Syria has repeatedly reaffirmed its sovereignty over the Golan Heights, saying the territory must be completely restored to its control.

The United Nations has also underlined Syria’s sovereignty over the territory.
