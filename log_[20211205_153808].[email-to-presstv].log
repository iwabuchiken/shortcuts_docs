<Robbery article, black folks pictures>

 i read an article on the robbery incidents in the USA ("Smash-and-grab robberies spike across US " https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2021/12/04/671983/US-Society-Crime-Rise)

1) What happened
 I read this article and wanted to send a comment through presstv.ir's "Contact Us" section. I entered the suggested security code. "Incorrect security code" returns. I tried several times, with several browsers. I could not make it. So I write in this comment section.
 
2) Description
 The article is about the increasing number of robberies in USA. There is a picture over the headline. It shows two people in a parking lot, holding a large square cardboard case. The one person is a black person, the other is of the dark skin.

3) Contention
As you may get it after the above short mentioning, the robbery report and the usage of black folks images. I find this mix inappropriate.

4) Backgrounds
 I read the other day on your website an article. It reports about a tweet by the Russian ambassador to Iran. He tweeted an image, showing the nation heads at the Tehran Conference in 1943.
 The writer of the article said such a tweet is despicable. I agree.

5) Request
 Please consider(though you staff members are maybe paying already much attention to the usage of photos in general in daily works) about the usage of photo in this article.

6) Others
 I read presstv articles every day. Please keep your dignified(yeah, I consider so) website as it is.
